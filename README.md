# Prog
Programming problems, done within a repo for use of pull requests.

## Folder structure
The 'users' folder contains one folder per student. Within each student folder, we'll create a new folder during each class, containing the work for that week.

The 'Answer' folder will be updated with the problems and one possible answer after class, for those who missed it.
